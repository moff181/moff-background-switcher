# Install

1. Make a new folder where you want to put all your backgrounds
1. Download the latest release and unzip it

1. Right click and add a new shortcut. Set the path to be "INSTALL_DIRECTORY/MoffBackgroundSwitcher.exe". E.g. if you unzipped it in "C:\MyPrograms", the shortcut path would be "C:\MyPrograms\MoffBackgroundSwitcher.exe"
